# Pet Management System Demo

This document provides a demo walkthrough of the Pet Management System.

## Demo Overview

The Pet Management System consists of:

1. **FastAPI Backend** - REST API with authentication and pet management
2. **Flutter Mobile App** - Cross-platform mobile application with GetX state management

## Demo Steps

### 1. Backend API Demo

The backend is running at `http://localhost:8000` with the following endpoints:

#### API Documentation

- Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation
- The API includes full OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

#### Available Endpoints:

- **GET /** - Root endpoint (health check)
- **POST /auth/register** - User registration
- **POST /auth/login** - User login
- **GET /pets** - Get user's pets (requires authentication)
- **POST /pets** - Add new pet (requires authentication)

### 2. Mobile App Demo Flow

#### Step 1: App Launch

- App starts with a splash screen showing the Pet Management logo
- Automatically checks for stored authentication token
- Redirects to login if not authenticated, or pets list if authenticated

#### Step 2: User Registration

- New users can register with email and password
- Input validation for email format and password length
- Success leads to automatic login and navigation to pets list

#### Step 3: User Login

- Existing users can login with email and password
- JWT token is received and stored securely
- Successful login navigates to pets list

#### Step 4: Pet List Screen

- Shows all pets belonging to the authenticated user
- Initially empty for new users
- Includes refresh functionality
- Logout option in app bar
- Floating action button to add new pets

#### Step 5: Add Pet

- Form with the following fields:
  - Pet Name (required, min 2 characters)
  - Pet Type (dropdown with common types + custom option)
  - Age (required, 0-50 years)
  - Notes (optional)
- Input validation with error messages
- Success returns to pets list with new pet displayed

#### Step 6: View Updated Pet List

- New pet appears in the list immediately
- Pet card shows name, type, age, and notes
- Professional card-based UI design

## Demo Video Script

### Introduction (15 seconds)

"Welcome to the Pet Management System demo. This is a full-stack application built with Flutter and FastAPI that allows users to manage their pet information."

### Backend Demo (30 seconds)

"First, let's look at the backend. We have a FastAPI server running on localhost:8000 with interactive documentation. The API includes user authentication and pet management endpoints with proper validation and security."

### Mobile App Demo (60 seconds)

"Now let's see the mobile app in action:

1. The app starts with a splash screen
2. New users can register with email and password
3. The login process is secure with JWT tokens
4. The pets list is initially empty for new users
5. Users can add pets with details like name, type, age, and notes
6. The pet appears immediately in the list
7. All data is synchronized with the backend API"

### Technical Highlights (15 seconds)

"Key technical features include GetX state management, input validation, secure authentication, and clean architecture following best practices."

## Running the Demo

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install email-validator
python main.py
```

Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Mobile App

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Test Flow

1. Start backend server
2. Launch mobile app
3. Register a new user
4. Add several pets
5. Test logout and login again
6. Verify data persistence

## Demo Data Examples

### Sample Users

- Email: `john@example.com`, Password: `password123`
